    "# Amines for Carbon Capture: DMET based fragmentation stratergy\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "The objective is to solve accurately the electronic structure problem $H|\\psi> = E|\\psi>$. For small molecules this is possible on a classical computer. Yet, precise calculations of the electronic structure of large molecules typically come at a high computational expense. For instance, the cost of doing the entire CI calculation grows exponentially with system size. Consequently, it becomes crucial to use an effective technique for cutting the computing cost while keeping accuracy while performing electronic structure calculations when we focus on large-sized molecules, those vital for industrial problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "One such approach is to break down a molecular system into its component parts and their environments, for each part separately, depending on the problem. Then, a less precise method than the one that will be used to compute the electrical structure of a fragment is employed to calculate the environment surrounding it. The electronic structure problem for a specific fragment is then precisely solved, taking into account the environment's quantum mechanical effects. The  accurate calculation is incorporated into the quantum mechanical description, which is then updated i.e., solved iteratively.\n",

    "## DMET\n",
    "\n",
    "A molecule is broken down into fragments using the DMET approach, and each fragment is viewed as an open quantum system that is entangled with every other piece, collectively constituting the fragment's environment (or \"bath\"). According to this framework, a highly accurate quantum chemistry approach, such as the complete CI method or a coupled-cluster method, is used to solve the following Hamiltonian in order to determine the electronic structure of a given fragment.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "H_I = \\sum_{rs}^{frag+bath}\\left[ h_{rs} + \\sum_{mn}[(rs|mn) - (rn|ms)]D_{mn}^{(mf)env}\\right] a_r^{\\dagger}a_s + \\sum_{pqrs}^{frag+bath} (pq|rs) a_p^{\\dagger}a_r^{\\dagger}a_sa_q - \\mu\\sum_r^{frag}a_r^{\\dagger}a_r\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The expression $\\sum_{mn}[(rs|mn) - (rn|ms)]D_{mn}^{(mf)env}$ describes the quantum mechanical effects of the environment on the fragment, where $D_{mn}^{(mf)env}$  is the mean-field electronic density obtained by solving the Hartree–Fock equation. The Hamiltonian's one-particle term incorporates the environmental quantum mechanical effects. By adjusting $\\mu$, the additional term $\\mu\\sum_r^{frag}a_r^{\\dagger}a_r$ makes sure that the system's overall number of electrons and the amount of electrons in each of the pieces are equal."

    "We perform DMET calculations on $CO_2 @ CH_3NH_2$ system. We consider two fragments of the system as shown above. Each fragment is solved using CCSD as electronic structure solver. We need to define an orbital localization technique for DMET. Here we use Meta-Lowdin localization. The iterations optimises the global chemical potential $\\mu_{global}$ such that the electrons in the fragments are closer to the actual number of electrons of the system. The optmisation uses newton-raphson method."
